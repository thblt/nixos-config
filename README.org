This repository contains my NixOS configuration files for various machines.

* Organization

This repository is structured as follows:

| Path      | Contents                                                                                            |
|-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| =/=         | To check out as =/etc/nixos=                                                                          |
| =/machines= | Descriptions of actual computers.  Each file is called =hostname.nix=.                                |
| =/class=    | Machine classes.  A class is generally an abstraction of some *hardware* property, eg being a laptop. |
| =/roles=    | Machine roles.  A role is what a machine is *for*.                                                    |

To setup a machine, I simply symlink =machines/{hostname}.nix= to =/etc/nixos/configuration.nix=
