#+TITLE: /etc/nixos/

This is my NixOS/home-manager/nix-darwin configuration for my desktops
computers (a category that includes laptops and also a Mac, but not
servers or headless).  It's extremely boring.

The ASCII font used for the hostname header in =configuration-*.nix= is
called [[https://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&f=Bloody&t=Hostame][Bloody]].
