#+TITLE: /etc/nixos/

This is my NixOS configuration for my desktops PCs (a category that
includes laptops, but not servers or headless).  It's extremely
boring.  To use it, I:

#+begin_src shell
  ln -s configuration-$(hostname).nix configuration.nix
#+end_src

=hardware-configuration.nix= is not included, since Iâ€¯don't modify it.
The bulk of the config is in =common.nix=, the packages in
=packages.nix=.  I haven't switched to home-manager yet, so this works
with my [[https://github.com/thblt/dotfiles/][dotfiles]] and my [[https://github.com/thblt/.emacs.d/][emacs configuration]].

The ASCII font used for the hostname header in configuration-*.nix is
called [[https://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&f=Bloody&t=Hostame][Bloody]].
